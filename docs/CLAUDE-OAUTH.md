# Claude OAuth (draft)

This fork contains a first-stage native Claude Code OAuth authorization-code
flow. It is intentionally separate from provider switching and from the
existing reader for credentials created by the Claude CLI.

## Flow

1. Call `AuthService::start("claude_oauth", None)` (or provide a localhost
   callback such as `http://localhost:54545/callback`).
2. Open the returned `authorization_url` in a browser.
3. Pass the complete browser callback URL to
   `AuthService::complete("claude_oauth", callback_url)`.
4. The native service validates the redirect origin, callback `state`, expiry,
   and authorization errors, then exchanges the code with Anthropic.

`AuthService` is provider-neutral: `start(provider, redirect_uri)` dispatches
to a provider strategy and returns either a `device_code` or `browser` tagged
response. Adding another browser OAuth provider therefore adds an adapter and
dispatch entry, not `start_<provider>_login` methods to the facade.

The public result contains only an authorization URL or an account summary.
Access and refresh tokens belong to cc-switch and are written under
`~/.cc-switch/credentials/claude.json` (mode `0600` on Unix). This flow never
writes macOS Keychain or Claude Code's `~/.claude/.credentials.json`; syncing
an account into Claude Code is a separate, explicit integration. Tokens are
never serialized into the JavaScript/N-API response or provider settings.

## Scope of this draft

The draft covers PKCE (S256), state binding, callback validation, token
exchange, and a single native account record. It does not yet provide account
listing, refresh, logout, profile/roles enrichment, or an N-API binding. Those
should land as separate follow-up changes after the protocol and storage
contract are reviewed.

The callback listener is expected to be owned by the desktop shell. The
service accepts a callback URL so a shell can use its own one-shot localhost
listener or a deep-link bridge without exposing token material to the UI.

## Compatibility note

The endpoint and client values follow the Claude Code OAuth protocol used by
the current CLIProxyAPI implementation. They are not a promise that Anthropic
will support arbitrary third-party clients or redirect URIs; production use
needs an explicit compatibility/security review.
